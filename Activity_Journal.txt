Level 1 – Food DB Load – Complete
Actual Time	04 00
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
- The FoodDB.txt should be hardcode in and the database should be built in FoodDB.rb

Actual Time	02 00
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
- The string.downcase! will returns 'nil' if there's nothing changed.
- Use String.start_with? method to test the prefix

Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

================================================================
Overall Summary
Estimated Total Time	11 00
Actual Total Time	14 00
Project reflection:
- Each function is really hard to write separate test cases for.
- After the projects, I have understand a lot more about Ruby's syntax
- To test 'main.rb', run 'test_command' one time. The expecting output is in the 'expected_output' file.
- The original text files are saved separately too.
